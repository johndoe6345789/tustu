# Data Files

This folder contains JSON data files generated by analysis and mapping scripts.

## Files

### COMPLETE_RENAME_MAPPING.json
**Source:** `rename_obfuscated_files.py` (legacy)  
**Purpose:** Complete mapping for renaming obfuscated Java files  
**Contains:**
- File rename mappings (old path → new path)
- Obfuscated class map
- Import dependencies
- Files requiring updates

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generated via legacy script, can be used for reference
python3 ../legacy/rename_obfuscated_files.py --execute
```

### JAVA_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.json
**Source:** Java analysis scripts  
**Purpose:** Results from analyzing Java codebase  
**Contains:**
- Class information
- Package structure
- Code metrics

### PACKAGE_MAPPING.json
**Source:** Package reorganization scripts  
**Purpose:** Mapping of package names and structure  
**Contains:**
- Package declarations
- Directory structure
- Mismatches between declared and actual locations

### STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.json
**Source:** `tustu_tools.py analyze` or `reorganize_structure.py`  
**Purpose:** Project structure analysis results  
**Contains:**
- Total file counts
- Package statistics
- Mismatched files
- Obfuscated vs proper packages

**Generate new analysis:**
```bash
cd ..
python3 tustu_tools.py analyze -o data/STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.json
```

## Usage

These files are primarily for reference and analysis purposes. They document:
- Historical code structure
- Transformation mappings
- Analysis results

Most can be regenerated using `tustu_tools.py` commands if needed.

## Updating

To regenerate structure analysis:
```bash
cd /path/to/tustu
./tustu-tools analyze -o scripts/data/STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.json
```

## Notes

- These files are typically **not** committed to version control (large, generated data)
- They serve as snapshots of analysis at specific points in time
- Useful for understanding code transformations and refactoring decisions
